Most of the configuration procedures mentioned in this manual are designed
to be carried out using Ansible. The same steps can be of course done manually.

You can install Ansible using your distribution's package manager (but it might be
quite old). Please consult the official docs:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#

# Configuration file

Most of the details describing our router is stored in `host_vars/router.yml`. After
reading chapters one and two you should be able to set all required variables. I'll briefly
explain them here:

Variable | Description
-------- | -----------
`ansible_user` | This variable should be set to a user with elevated privileges on the router. This probably will be the user you created during installation of the OS. Please remember, that the default method of elevating privileges in Ansible is `sudo`, which is not installed by default on Debian. Please install `sudo` and add the `ansible_user` to the `sudo` group.
`ansible_connection` | There are several methods to connect to a managed host. We will use SSH.
