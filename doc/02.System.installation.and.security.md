Installing the Debian operating system is not covered here fully, but some good practices
and secure considerations are presented below.

# Encryption

If you plan to keep private stuff on the router's `/root`, `/home` or any other partition,
**use** LUKS. If you do not plan to do this, encrypting an external drive should be enough.
If you plan to use Wireguard (described later), all keys and configuration will reside
on the system drive. If someone brake into your home and steal the router with all
the keys, it also shouldn't be a problem. You will need another router with different keys
and configuration. There should be no other secrets on the system drive that can cause any damage.

Not encrypting the system drive has the benefit, that you can reboot the router while being
away, or you can ask someone at home to do this. People at your home are not necesarrily
technical. They, for example, might not want to unmount the router with all the cables
attached from the shelf or a special holder behind the desk. If the router is headless,
they also should connect a monitor and keyboard to provide the password for the LUKS drive.

Please note that:
* `/boot` should probably be left unencrypted. Everything on this partition will be vulnerable,
  but is shouldn't be a problem if you keep the router at home. Encrypting the `/boot` partition
  **is** possible, but it is **a lot** of work and probably not needed in your setup.

* You may want to use LVM, but it is probably also an overkill in this situation.
* You may want to use separate partitions for `/`, `/var` and `/tmp`.
* Keeping `/usr/` separate is sometimes a viable options. For example, after doing all the work
  you can try to mount `/usr` read-only, potentially increasing the security of the system.

## External drive encryption

If you plan to use an external drive to keep your backups or any other sensitive information,
**use LUKS**. Do not keep your private stuff unencrypted. Stealing a pendrive or an external
drive might be a personal catastrophy in such situation. Also, do not keep the data unecrypted
all the time. Decrypt the drive only when doing work or backups, then close the LUKS partition.

Additionally, use a backup solution that will not only keep your data organized, but also
offers encryption capabilities.  
Like Borg: https://www.borgbackup.org/
This way you will have almost impregnable backups. If you use **strong** passphrases of course...

# Passwords and passphrases

Please, change your thinking from passwords to passphrases. And use a passphrase manager. KeePassXC
is a good choice: https://keepassxc.org/  
This way you will only have to remember one **strong** passphrase.
